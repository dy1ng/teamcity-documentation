[//]: # (title: VCS Labeling)
[//]: # (auxiliary-id: VCS Labeling)

TeamCity can label (tag) sources of a particular build (automatically or manually) in your Version Control System. The list of applied labels and their application status is displayed on the __[Changes](working-with-build-results.md#Changes)__ tab of the __Build Results__ page.

## Automatic VCS labeling

You can set TeamCity to label the sources of a build depending on the build status automatically. The process takes place in the background after the build finishes and does not affect the build status, which means that a labeling failure is not a standard [notification event](subscribing-to-notifications.md#Which+Events+Will+Trigger+Notifications). However, the users subscribed to [notifications about failed builds](subscribing-to-notifications.md#Which+Events+Will+Trigger+Notifications) of the current build configuration will be notified about a labeling failure.

Any errors encountered during labeling are reported on the __[Changes](working-with-build-results.md#Changes)__ tab of the __Build Results__ page.

Labeling is configured per a build configuration/template.

Automatic VCS labeling is configured as a [build feature](adding-build-features.md). When adding the feature, you will need to specify the root to label and the labeling pattern.   
If there are [branches configured](working-with-feature-branches.md) for a build configuration, you can label only builds from specific [branches you select](branch-filter.md).

It is possible to override the labeling settings inherited from a template completely and apply different labels to different VCS roots.

<note>

Labeling uses the credentials specified for the VCS root. The write access to the source repository is required.

Note that if you change the VCS settings of a build configuration, they will be used for labeling only in the new builds.

"Moving" labels (a label with the same name for different builds, for example, `SNAPSHOT`) are currently supported only for CVS.

For an example of using the Teamcity VCS labeling feature to automate tag creation, refer to this [external posting](http://laurentkempe.com/2010/06/03/Build-and-Deployment-automation-VCS-Root-and-Labeling-in-TeamCity/).

## Manual VCS labeling

To label the sources manually, navigate to the __[Build Results](working-with-build-results.md)__ page, click __Actions__, and select _Label this build sources_ from the drop-down menu.

Manual labeling uses the VCS settings actual for the build.

## Subversion Labeling Rules
[//]: # (AltHead: SubversionLabelingRules)

To label Subversion VCS roots, it is required to set [labeling rules](subversion.md#Labeling+settings) defining the SVN repository structure.

Labeling rules are specified as newline-delimited rules in the following format:

```Plain Text
TrunkOrBranchRepositoryPath => tagDirectoryRepositoryPath

```

The repository paths can be relative and absolute (starting with `/`). Absolute paths are resolved from the SVN repository root (the topmost directory you have in your repository), relative paths are resolved from the TeamCity VCS root.

When creating a label, the sources residing under `TrunkOrBranchRepositoryPath` will be put into the `tagDirectoryRepositoryPath/tagName` directory, where `tagName` is the name of the label as defined by the labeling pattern of the build configuration.

If no sources match the `TrunkOrBranchRepositoryPath`, no label will be created.

The `tagDirectoryRepositoryPath` path must already exist in the repository.

If the `tagDirectoryRepositoryPath` directory already contains a subdirectory with the current label name, the labeling process will fail, and the old tag directory won't be deleted or affected.

For example, there is a VCS root with the URL `svn://address/root/project` where `svn://address/root` is the repository root, and the repository has the structure:

```Plain Text
-project
--trunk
--branch1
--branch2
--tags

```

In this case, the labeling rules should be:

```Plain Text
/project/trunk=>/project/tags
/project/branch1=>/project/tags
/project/branch2=>/project/tags

```

## Labeling Rule Examples

You can use variables substitution in both labeling rules and labeling patterns. See a labeling rule example in a VCS root used in different configurations:

```Plain Text
/projects/%projectName%/trunk => /projects/%projectName%/tags

```

This will require you to set the `%projectName%` [configuration parameter](configuring-build-parameters.md) in the build configuration settings.

By default, TeamCity will append the label name to the end of the specified target path. If you want to have a different directory structure and put the label in the middle of the target path, you can use the following syntax:

```Plain Text
/project/trunk => /tagged_configurations/%%system.build.label%%/project
/modules/module1/trunk => /tagged_configurations/%%system.build.label%%/module1
/modules/module2/trunk => /tagged_configurations/%%system.build.label%%/module2

```

Thus, `%%system.build.label%%` will be replaced with the tag name (note the double `%%` sign at the beginning â€” it is important).
